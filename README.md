This project was started at the [PLOS article level metrics hackathon](http://articlemetrics.github.io/workshop_2014/) on 2014-12-06. The hackathon repo: https://github.com/articlemetrics/hackathon_2014 

This repo contains R code to collect links to resources associated with an article. So far we've focused on F1000Research articles to start with. Obviously, in production we'd want to switch to something like Ruby or Python.
